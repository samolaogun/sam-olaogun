/**
 * Spring
 * 
 * @description The way that a spring animation works no different than physical oscillation.
 * In both real life and in the digital world, springs can be represented by a function 
 * called a "damped oscillation". For a function to be damped simply means that as the
 * function progresses, or as the x value of the function increases, the y value, or the 
 * function output approches a single value, which in this case is 0. I chose to 
 * create this animation using javascript because CSS animations are clamped to a specific range, 
 * which means that they do not support elastic behaviors such as this.
 * Keep in mind that this is a true spring animation (a spring is never truly stable), but 
 * more just a visual illusion (the limit can never be reached). Additionally, I'm not actually 
 * specifiying conditions for SHM (spring constant, dx, etc.).

 * the domain (the tension value), the tension increase. Because the domain is scaled

 * 
 * Initial Velocity - Phase shift to change (left, down)
 * shift function down and to the right to fix init velocity and
 * change crest height (1.6142) to fit by plugging the new x offset
 * value into the function (intercept, x+= val).
